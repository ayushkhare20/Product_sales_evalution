1.	Noise is present in the data, the participant must make a valid judgement on how to deal with it.
2.	In real world data, noise varies on a large degree. The given dataset is an actual real world data.
3.	Noise mostly gets induced due to the way they collect the data, some human error and most often due to data aggregations while preparing the data.
4.	Working on this kind of data would prepare the participants to handle the complicacies that they would face in the future.
 
5.	This a pre-modeling insight extraction competition, so there is no need to use any ML models here.
6.	In any company Data Scientists take 1-3 months of duration for Data Analysis itself. Only a small proportion occupies where they’d be using ML models.
7.	Due to the insights they were able to capture during the 1-3 months, Data Scientists would know which models meet the Parametric Assumptions of the data. So choosing the right model is not a biggie. That is the reason why analysis is an important aspect.
8.	Plots without any meaning are not useful, justify what you’re trying to tell through your plots and analysis.
